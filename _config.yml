title: [The cool patent]
description: [Finding the common characteristics or relations to their features among influential patents, can help inventors to follow the same practice. And moreover, it opens possibility of predicting patent’s infuentience. In this project, by using number of references to individual patent, we’ll evaluate each patent’s influence. Then, we can do exploratory analysis on dataset and our evaluations to find general trends. From here, we will try to apply machine learning methods to create prediction model. We’re using US patent data provided by PatentsView.org in this project.]
